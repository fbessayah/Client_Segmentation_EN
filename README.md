Customer segmentation is a key lever for any company aiming to optimize customer relationships and improve commercial performance.  
A comprehensive customer analysis allows organizations to:

- Understand customer behavior  
- Compute marketing indicators  
- Segment customers using clustering algorithms
- Interpret the resulting segments  
- Provide actionable marketing recommendations  

This project is designed as a complete **Marketing Data Analysis** case study, from data preparation to strategic analysis.

## 📊 Methodology

This project performs customer segmentation based on the **RFM method (Recency – Frequency – Monetary)**.  
The goal is to identify groups of customers with similar behaviors in order to support effective marketing strategies: retention, loyalty programs, reactivation, personalized offers, and more.

### 🔎 Understanding the RFM Variables

The RFM method relies on three key indicators derived from a customer's purchase history:

- **Recency**  
  Measures the number of days since the customer's last purchase.  
  → A lower recency indicates a more “active” customer.

- **Frequency**  
  Represents the total number of transactions made by the customer.  
  → Customers who purchase frequently show high engagement with the e-commerce site.

- **Monetary**  
  Corresponds to the total amount spent by the customer during the analysis period.  
  → High-monetary customers contribute the most to revenue.

These three dimensions enable the creation of precise behavioral profiles for each customer and serve as the foundation for segmentation using a clustering algo
